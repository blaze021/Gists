# Application Config Documentation

## Overview

This document provides guidance on configuring the cron based application using config stored in values.yaml as a ConfigMap . 

```
cronvalues:
  - cronschedule: "0 22 * * *"
    instances: "0"
  - cronschedule: "0 18 * * *"
    instances: "1"
  - cronschedule: "0 7 * * *"
    instances: "3"
```

Here for each array element:
1) cronschedule would be the scheduled time in US/Eastern timezone in which the pods will scale.
2) instances will be the no of replicas running for your deployment. So for example if you want to scale down your application to 0 instances, you'll have to specify the instances to zero.

### HelmRelease Configuration

1. In your Helm chart's `values.yaml` file, configure the HelmRelease to reference the AppConfig stored in the ConfigMap.

    ```yaml
    helmReleases:
      - name: my-application
        chart: my-application-chart
        version: 1.0.0
        valuesFrom:
          - secretKeyRef:
              name: app-config
              key: appconfig.yml
    ```

2. Ensure that your Helm chart's templates properly use the values from the AppConfig within the `my-application-chart/templates` directory.

## Kustomization Integration

To include the `appconfig.yml` in the kustomization, follow these steps:

1. Create a `kustomization.yaml` file in the root of your Kubernetes manifests directory (if not already created).

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
      - appconfig.yaml
    ```

2. Apply the kustomization to your Kubernetes cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -k .
    ```

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can effectively manage your application's configuration using AppConfig stored in a ConfigMap, integrate it with HelmRelease's valuesFrom feature, and include it in the kustomization for streamlined deployment and configuration management.
