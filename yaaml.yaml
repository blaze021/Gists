# Application Config Documentation

## Overview

This document provides guidance on configuring the cron based application using config stored in values.yaml as a ConfigMap . 

```
cronvalues:
  - cronschedule: "0 22 * * *"
    instances: "0"
  - cronschedule: "0 18 * * *"
    instances: "1"
  - cronschedule: "0 7 * * *"
    instances: "3"
```

Here for each array element:
1) cronschedule would be the scheduled time in US/Eastern timezone in which the pods will scale.
2) instances will be the no of replicas running for your deployment. So for example if you want to scale down your application to 0 instances, you'll have to specify the instances to zero.

### HelmRelease Configuration

1. In your _appconfig/gitops//<cluster>/<namespace>/<app_name>-<env>/resources/`app-helm-release.yaml` file, configure the HelmRelease to reference the ConfigMap stored in the saame folder as app-cronconfig.yaml.

    ```yaml
    helmReleases:
      - name: my-application
        chart: my-application-chart
        version: 1.0.0
        valuesFrom:
          - secretKeyRef:
              name: app-config
              key: appconfig.yml
    ```
## Kustomization Integration

To include the `app-cronconfig.yml` in the kustomization, follow these steps:

1. Add the file in the root of your Kustomiztion manifest.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
      - appconfig.yaml
    ```
