I see, if you haven't received any client requests yet, here's the revised summary:

**Client Interaction:**
- **Regular Updates**: I have consistently provided clients with regular updates, even though we have not yet received any client requests. This proactive communication ensures that clients are informed about our readiness to assist them whenever requests do come in.

- **Onboarding Challenges**: Onboarding client applications to the service mesh has been delayed due to the absence of client requests. Consequently, tests and proof-of-concept (POC) activities for the client's apps are pending until we receive those requests.

- **Understanding Customer Requirements**: Despite the absence of client requests, I have initiated a series of activities aimed at being well-prepared to understand and cater to our customer's requirements when they do come in. These efforts include discussions and analyses to proactively gather insights into their specific needs and preferences.

Certainly, here's your self-evaluation in your own voice:

**Resiliency Automation and Collaboration Self-Evaluation:**

1. **Service Mesh Knowledge:** I took the initiative to invest in my knowledge and skills in the field of service mesh by completing a comprehensive course provided by Tetrate on Istio and Envoy. This effort allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the current service mesh landscape, which is crucial for our projects.

2. **Kubernetes Certification:** I recognize the importance of showcasing my expertise in Kubernetes, a technology I'm already well-versed in. To validate my proficiency and stay up-to-date, I have scheduled the CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) test for November this year. This certification will not only demonstrate my knowledge but also highlight my dedication to continuous improvement.

3. **Tech and Innovation Engagement:** In pursuit of staying at the forefront of technology and innovation, I actively participated in various hackathons both within our organization and externally throughout the year. These experiences have provided me with practical insights, expanded my problem-solving abilities, and fostered collaboration within the tech community.

In summary, my commitment to self-improvement and staying updated in the realms of Resiliency Automation and Collaboration is evident through these actions. I believe that these efforts will not only benefit my professional growth but also contribute positively to our team and organization as a whole.
