It looks like `script_a.sh` is getting stuck at `script_b.sh &`, which is intended to run in the background, but something in `script_b.sh` might still be causing the blocking behavior.

Here are a few things to check and try to resolve the issue:

### 1. **Redirect Output of `script_b.sh`:**
   The issue might be caused by `script_b.sh` still writing to standard output or standard error. By default, even when run in the background, the script's output may still tie up the terminal and prevent `script_a.sh` from continuing.

   Try redirecting both `stdout` and `stderr` to `/dev/null` to fully detach the background process:

   ```bash
   script_b.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

### 2. **Disown the Background Process:**
   After putting the process in the background, you may want to disown it so that it doesn't hold up the parent process (`script_a.sh`).

   ```bash
   script_b.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   disown
   ```

   `disown` ensures that `script_a.sh` won't wait on `script_b.sh` to complete or interact with it.

### 3. **Check `script_b.sh` Logic:**
   Ensure that `script_b.sh`'s loop or any code within isn't hanging or misbehaving in such a way that it's affecting the parent script. If `script_b.sh` takes too long to initialize, it might also give the impression that `script_a.sh` is stuck.

### Example `script_a.sh`:

```bash
# code here 1...

# Run script_b.sh in background, with output and error redirected and process disowned
script_b.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &

disown

# code here 2 ...
```

### Example `script_b.sh`:

```bash
while true
do
    # Some background task
    echo "Background process running"
    
    sleep 5
done
```

This approach should allow `script_a.sh` to continue after starting `script_b.sh` in the background without being blocked.

Creating a structured Flask API with the specified folder structure involves organizing your code in a modular way, making it easier to manage and maintain. Here’s a step-by-step guide with the example code for each file:

### Folder Structure
```
my_flask_app/
├── app.py
├── routes/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── flux.py
│   ├── kube_ctl.py
│   └── helmctl.py
└── utils/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── util.py
```

### 1. app.py
This is the main file that initializes the Flask application and registers the blueprints.

```python
from flask import Flask
from routes.flux import flux_bp
from routes.kube_ctl import kube_ctl_bp
from routes.helmctl import helmctl_bp

app = Flask(__name__)

# Register blueprints
app.register_blueprint(flux_bp, url_prefix='/flux')
app.register_blueprint(kube_ctl_bp, url_prefix='/kube')
app.register_blueprint(helmctl_bp, url_prefix='/helm')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 2. routes/flux.py
This file defines the routes related to Flux.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify

flux_bp = Blueprint('flux', __name__)

@flux_bp.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
def status():
    return jsonify({"status": "Flux is running"})
```

### 3. routes/kube_ctl.py
This file defines the routes related to Kubernetes control.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify

kube_ctl_bp = Blueprint('kube_ctl', __name__)

@kube_ctl_bp.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
def status():
    return jsonify({"status": "Kubernetes control is running"})
```

### 4. routes/helmctl.py
This file defines the routes related to Helm control.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify

helmctl_bp = Blueprint('helmctl', __name__)

@helmctl_bp.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
def status():
    return jsonify({"status": "Helm control is running"})
```

### 5. utils/util.py
This file contains utility functions that can be used across different parts of the application.

```python
def common_util_function():
    return "This is a common utility function."
```

### 6. routes/__init__.py
This file makes the `routes` directory a package.

```python
# This file can be empty or you can initialize something if needed.
```

### 7. utils/__init__.py
This file makes the `utils` directory a package.

```python
# This file can be empty or you can initialize something if needed.
```

### Putting It All Together
1. **Run the Application**: To run the application, navigate to the directory containing `app.py` and execute the command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. **Access the Endpoints**:
    - Flux status: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/flux/status`
    - Kubernetes control status: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/kube/status`
    - Helm control status: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/helm/status`

This structure organizes the code into separate files for different routes and utilities, making it modular and easier to manage.

When Gremlin is installed into an SELinux system as a container (e.g Docker constainer, Kubernetes daemonset), the container runtime that manages Gremlin will run the Gremlin processes under the SELinux process label type container_t. Gremlin performs some actions that are not allowed by this process label:

    Install and manipulate files on the host: /var/lib/gremlin, /var/log/gremlin
    Load kernel modules for manipulating network transactions during network attacks, such as net_sch
    Communicate with the container runtime socket (e.g. /var/run/docker.sock) to launch containers that carry out attacks
    Read files in /proc

When you install Gremlin as root directly onto your host machines, you likely do not need to install any of these policies, as Gremlin should run under SELinux process label type unconfined_t.

To alleviate the privilege restrictions imposed on container_t, you can allow these privileges to container_t, providing Gremlin with everything it needs, but this would also give the same privileges to all other containers on your system, which is not ideal.

This project crates a new process label type gremlin.process and adds all the necessary privileges Gremlin needs, so that you can grant them to Gremlin only, and nothing else.

Gremlin builds on the SELinux inheritance patterns set out in containers/udica, providing Gremlin privileges on top of standard container privileges. See the policy here.
